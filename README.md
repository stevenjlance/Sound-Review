# Sound

We need to add some sound to our game in order to enhance the user experience! Using resources like [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org/) allows us to upload sounds and use them when certain events happen in our programs.

## Sound Practice

1. Download this [Coin Sound](https://freesound.org/people/ProjectsU012/sounds/341695/) from freesound.org
2. Upload the sound to this repl.it file by clicking the 3 dots and selecting "Upload File"
3. Create a varaible to store the sound and load the sound into this variable inside the `function preload` using the `loadSound()` command.
4. Play the sound when the spacebar is pressed.
